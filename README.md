# GuestList
This is a project made in Java and it scope is to make a program that can manage a guestlist. It has three classes:

- Guest : It is a class that is used to hold the informations about a guest ( name, email, phone number)
- GuestList : This class has two arraylists (participant and waitParticipant) that manages the guests. We can add, remove or search for a guest on the participant list or on the waiting list.
- Main : This class can be used for checking the way the program works.To be faster, I created a GUI that controls the guestlist
